# Fleet Management System (FMS)

> This is a microservices-based backend platform designed to manage a fleet of vehicles and monitor driver behavior in real time. It provides tools to register and track cars, drivers, and trips, simulate live driving conditions, and automatically apply penalties based on unsafe driving patterns.

> The project uses **Quarkus** as the **Java** framework and Docker for local development.
